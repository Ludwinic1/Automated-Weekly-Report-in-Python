# Automated-Weekly-Report-in-Python
Data Engineer Project:  Automating a Weekly Analytics Report in Python.  

Created a scipt in Python that automates a weekly analytics report for a fictional bank loan database.  The user can select any time period and the script will generate a range of useful analytics and info.  Only Python's built-in modules were used to show more in-depth code and how powerful the standard data structures can be.
