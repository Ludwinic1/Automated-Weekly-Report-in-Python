# Automating-Weekly-Report
Data Engineer Project:  Automating a Weekly Analytics Report in Python

The objective was to create a script that reads in an Excel file (csv with all strings) that contains info from a fictional bank loan database. Then, by typing in any start and end date, the script will give the user a range of useful analytics for that time period. The dates on the file are between 01/01/2020 and 03/28/2020. The script also factors in blank values and converts the data types when needed. 
Real world application: Data analyst has to export data to Excel from a Customer Management System to constrcut a weekly report for senior management. Instead of having to sort the data, apply multiple filters, and build a new report from scratch every week with new data, running this script will generate everything extremely quickly and accurately. 
Real world application two: Analyst has to run various ad-hoc reports. For instance, how many loans were closed during the first quarter, for the year, or what the current approved new loan pipeline is. The script is flexible and allows the analyst to generate the information fast. 
For this project, only Python's built-in modules were used to show more in-depth code and how powerful the standard data structures can be.
